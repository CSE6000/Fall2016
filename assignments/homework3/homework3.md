Due Wednesday, November 14, 2016, by 23:59 PM KST

The goals of this homework are to :
- Get some experience with OpenCV and LAPACK(MKL)

Before tackling this homework, you should read related class notes and sample codes.
 - [Affine transformation](slides/ec_siip_10.pdf)
 - [BLAS and LAPACK](slides/ec_siip_11.pdf)
 - [Solving linear systems with MKL](slides/ec_siip_12.pdf)

## 3-1 Affine warp with OpenCV

## 3-2 Affine warp with LAPACK

## 3-3 Submission
 - At the end you should have the following files committed to your repository:
  * `/assignments/homework3/AffineTransformation
  * `/assignments/homework3/affine_warp_opencv.txt`
  * `/assignments/homework3/affine_warp_LAPACK.txt`

 Do not add other files such as `Taylor.exe`, which was created when the c code was compiled.

 **NOTE** You should follow the file path listed above.

## 3-4 Tag your homework
 - Tag the commit as 'homework3' that you want graded. If you submit the wrong thing or make further changes to your work before the due date, you can delete old tag and re-tag to new commit.
