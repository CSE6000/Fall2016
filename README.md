# CSE6000 Fall2016
Class page for Embedded computing for scientific and industrial imaging applications

- Course: CSE6000-01, Dept. of CSE, Yonsei University
- Instructor: Eunjung Lee (eunjunglee(at)yonsei.ac.kr), HanByul Yang (yhbyhb@(at)onsei.ac.kr)
- ASTC 516, Mon 16:00 ~ 18:50

## Course Description
The aim of this course is to design embedded systems in devices and structures which are established to function for scientific imaging in mobile, remote, and non-tethered environments. Assuming a background in computational science and engineering, this course introduces the students to embedded computing techniques for scientific and industrial imaging.

## Prerequisites
Some programming experience in some language, e.g., Python, Matlab, C/C++, Java. Swift, C#

You should be comfortable
- editing a file containing a program and executing it,
- using basic structures like loops, if-then-else, input-output
- writing subroutines or functions in some language

You are not expected to know C

Some basic knowledge of linear algebra
- vector or matrices addition, multiplication,
- solving a linear system Some comfort level

Some comfort level for learning new software and willingness to dive into lots of new things

## Goal of Course
Essential skills for embedded computing
- Essential to know if you eventually want to work on embedded systems.
- Extremely useful for any embedded computing project, even on a laptop.

Strategy
- Concentrate on basics, simple motivating examples.
- Focusing hands-on experience.
- Learn what’s out there to help select what’s best for your needs.
